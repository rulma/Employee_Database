# Employee_Database

## Overview

We were tasked with creating and analyzing a database of employee information for a fictional company, Pwelett-Hackard, through our analysis we wanted to get an idea of the upcoming retirements within the company. We also wanted to look at employee eligibility for workplace mentorships based on age and employment. We conducted our analysis with SQL. 

## Results 

Four Key Takeaways:

+ Department Management Vacancies 
+ Weakening Senior Staff and Engineers
+ Strong Pool of Candidates to Mentor Current Employees
+ Loyal and Aging Workforce

#### Department Management Vacancies

As we can see in the above table there are two vacancies in our department leadership that must be filled as soon as possible. The longer a leadership role remains vacant the less effect a department will run. Leadership plays a critical role in guiding and prioritizing tasks for departments

#### Weakening Senior Staff and Engineers

In addition to two retiring department leaders there is also a sizable vacancy in both our senior staff and senior engineers. These are roles responsible for guiding and developing new employees within our company. It is imperative that there is a healthy pool of senior staff that are experienced and capable of leading teams and within their respective departments.

#### Strong Pool of Candidates to Mentor Current Employees

Despite the upcoming retirements there is a large pool of candidates that have been with the company for a while who would be excellent candidates for the mentorship program. By filling out the pool of mentors, newer staff would be able to be trained and prepared to take on the senior roles that have vacancies.

#### Loyal and Aging Workforce

Lastly, all of this data points to a workforce that is aging yet loyal to the company. In many instances, employees are working here for 20+ years which could be a sign of excellent company culture. New employees take note of things like this and may in turn be more likely to stay and grow with the company as well.

## Summary

In summation, the company's leadership and senior staff are retiring but there is a large pool of candidates ready to fill the void left by them but with only a small pool of mentors ready to train and prepare the next generation of leadership. There are currently 90,398 retiring employees. The pool of mentors is only 1,549. The discrepancy between retiring employees and mentors is striking and could pose a serious risk to Pewlett-Hackardâ€™s ability to withstand the upcoming "silver tsunami".

If we wanted to have a better understanding of the pool of available candidates there are a couple additional queries we could run. First, we could determine the number of employees who have been at the company for more than 3 years and who are not currently in a "Senior" role. This would give us an idea of the number of promotion ready employees able to be mentored. In addition we could also query the average time spent working at Pewlett-Hackard. Understanding our retention and turnover within departments may allow us to address high turnover rates.
